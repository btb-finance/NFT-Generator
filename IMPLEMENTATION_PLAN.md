## Phase 3: Integration
1. Update drawAvatar() function to handle all new traits
2. Map trait names to drawing functions
3. Test each tier to verify visual differences

## Phase 4: Testing
1. Generate 1000 test NFTs
2. Manually review samples from each tier
3. Verify Primordial looks GODLY
4. Verify Starter looks plain
5. Verify mid-tiers have clear progression

## Phase 5: Full Generation
1. Set editionSize to 100,000
2. Generate full collection
3. Create rarity report
4. Verify no duplicates

## Current Status
- Traits defined âœ…
- Need to implement 200+ drawing functions
- Estimated time: This will be a MASSIVE undertaking

## Strategy
Instead of drawing ALL 200+ traits manually, we can:
1. Create a **trait mapping system**
2. Reuse similar drawing code with COLOR/SIZE variations
3. Example: "golden crown", "platinum crown", "crystal crown" use same shape but different colors
4. This makes implementation MUCH faster
